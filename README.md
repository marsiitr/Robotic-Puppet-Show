It contains code and documentation of project made by my team for SRISHTI-2k18 under Model and Robotics Section.

# Gadgets used
1. Controller - Arduino Mega
2. 6 Servo motors
3. Steppermotor
4. motor driver
5. timing belt

# Design
- The whole designing process of the project includes the designing of the puppet and the platform on which it perform dance, speech, etc. For designing purpose the software used was solidworks in which we design the puppet and platform. After designing the puppet can be made by either 3-d printing or by wood or other materials manually. Different parts of the puppet if made seperately Suxh as arms, legs, head body, etc and the joined with the help of nuts and bolts. Similarly with the stage and the platform. And at the end paint the puppet and cover the stage with chart papers.

# Working
- Servo motor is controlled by arduino mega. We can set the angle at which it is rotated. We had set pins in arduino mega for 6 servo motors. We had used 6 servo motors for 6 part f puppets i.e. right upper arm , right lower arm , left upper arm , left lower arm , left and right legs. The puppet moves and performs different tasks such as dance, speech, etc. For making the puppet dance and perform task the servo motors and rotated according to the beats of the dance moved according to the speech. Different parts of the puupet is connected to servo mototrs with the threads. when servo motor rotates thread is pulled and the parts of the puppet moves. 
- Stepper motor is used to move th puppet in horizontal direction.The motor driver is used for moving the stepper motor. With the help arduino mega the motor driver is controlled and then the motor driver is connected to  the stepper motor. The stepper motor is connected to the timing belt and timing belt is attached to the platform on which servo motor is mounted and puppet is attached. When we rotate the stepper motor the platform moves in the horizontal direction.
Syncing the audio and movements of puppet. A simple code in python is used to sync the audio nad movements. when we run the code the audio and th novements starts at the same time.
